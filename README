can be used to reproduce the data (numbers and figures) in Examples
1-4 of the Numerical Results section of the paper "A canonical gauge
for computing eigenpairs of the magnetic Schr√∂dinger operator", by
Jeffrey S. Ovall and Li (Julie) Zhu. Please find the detailed
description of the code in the comments in notebook files.

In addition to needing jupyter, the code depends on having recent
implementations of NGSolve (https://ngsolve.org/) and pyeigfeast
(https://bitbucket.org/jayggg/pyeigfeast/wiki/Home).  Instructions for
downloading these software packages are given at the respective sites.

Version used in experiments:
NGSolve version: 6.2.2304-281-g0dff376c7
Python 3.11.5

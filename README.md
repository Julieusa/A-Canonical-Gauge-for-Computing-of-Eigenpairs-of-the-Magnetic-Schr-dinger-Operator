# A Canonical Gauge for Computing of Eigenpairs of the Magnetic Schr√∂dinger Operator

Code and examples for computing eigenpairs of the magnetic Schr√∂dinger operator using a canonical gauge. Companion code for [arXiv:2409.06023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06023). 

**Abstract**:  
We consider the eigenvalue problem for the magnetic Schr√∂dinger operator and take advantage of a property called *gauge invariance* to transform the given problem into an equivalent one that is more amenable to numerical approximation. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate that accurate computation of eigenpairs can be done more efficiently and stably with the canonical magnetic gauge.
